I am a Master student at [UC San Diego Halƒ±cƒ±oƒülu Data Science Institute](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/), working in Professor Biwei Huang's Causal Intellligence Lab. My research interests are in Causal Inference, focusing on leveraging the power of AI and Data Science to address problems in the Causality field.
Before joining UCSD, I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Statistics from The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Currently, I am actively looking for PhD oppotunities in the Causality field.

Open-Source Projects
------
I have a great passion for developing Data Science related projects and convert academic theories into applications.

- ‚≠êÔ∏è[**Causal-Copilot**](https://github.com/Lancelot39/Causal-Copilot)
  - Causal-Copilot is an LLM-oriented toolkit for Automatic Causal Analysis. Designed for scientific researchers and data scientists, it facilitates the identification, analysis, and interpretation of causal relationships within real-world datasets through natural dialogue.
  - If you are interested in it, please try our [demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Causal-Copilot/Causal-Copilot) here.

- ‚≠êÔ∏è[**CEM-LinearInf**](https://github.com/WenyiWU0111/CEM_LinearInf)
  - CEM-LinearInf is a Python package for linear causal inference, which can help you implement the whole process of causal inference easily.
  - If you are interested in it, please check the [documentation](https://cem-linearinf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) here.

- ‚≠êÔ∏è[**dnn-inference**](https://github.com/statmlben/dnn-inference)
  - dnn_inference is a Python module for hypothesis testing based on black-box models, including deep neural networks.
  - If you are interested in it, please check the [documentation](https://dnn-inference.readthedocs.io) here.


Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
