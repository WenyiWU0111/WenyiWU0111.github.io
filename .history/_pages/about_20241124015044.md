I am a Master student at [UC San Diego Halƒ±cƒ±oƒülu Data Science Institute](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/), working in Professor Biwei Huang's Causal Intellligence Lab. My research interests are in Causal Inference, focusing on leveraging the power of AI and Data Science to address problems in the Causality field.
Before joining UCSD, I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Statistics from The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Currently, I am actively looking for Ph.D. oppotunities in the Causality field.
